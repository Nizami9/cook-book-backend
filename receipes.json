Meanwhile, beat the eggs with the herbs and plenty of freshly ground black pepper in a small bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\n\nScoop the tomatoes from the pan and put them on two serving plates. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and stir gently with a wooden spoon so the egg that sets on the base of the pan moves to enable uncooked egg to flow into the space. Stop stirring when itâ€™s nearly cooked to allow it to set into an omelette. Cut into four and serve with the tomatoes."
