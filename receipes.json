Meanwhile, beat the eggs with the herbs and plenty of freshly ground black pepper in a small bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\n\nScoop the tomatoes from the pan and put them on two serving plates. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and stir gently with a wooden spoon so the egg that sets on the base of the pan moves to enable uncooked egg to flow into the space. Stop stirring when it’s nearly cooked to allow it to set into an omelette. Cut into four and serve with the tomatoes."
